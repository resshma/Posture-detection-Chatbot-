# Posture-detection-Chatbot-
Real-time posture detection using AI powered Chatbot with 98% classification accuracy.


* We built a real-time posture correction system using MoveNet and deep learning to identify incorrect standing postures like squats and sidebends. 

* This project was to prevent spinal and muscular issues, especially for athletes and sportspersons. 

We developed a posture correction system comparing four models : 

* Na√Øve Bayes (82.86%)
  
* MLP (81.8%)

* SVM (86.3%), and
  
* MoveNet (98.6%).

MoveNet, a deep learning-based pose detection model, outperformed all others in accuracy and real-time performance.

The model achieved 98.6% accuracy and provides automated suggestions for posture correction.
  
It accurately classified standing, squatting, and sidebend postures, making it the most reliable for live posture correction and fitness feedback applications.

This solution helps reduce the need for constant physiotherapist supervision, supporting long-term musculoskeletal health in fitness and healthcare settings.
